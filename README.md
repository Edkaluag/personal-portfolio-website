# Ed Palor Personal Website

This is my personal portfolio website, designed and developed based on my own digital wireframe. It showcases who I am as a concept artist and serves as a central hub for visitors to learn about me and get in touch.

## 🌐 Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic HTML structure (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>)
- **CSS3**: External stylesheet used for all layout and visual design
- **JavaScript**: Used for basic form interaction (alert on submit)

## ✅ Implemented Features
- Responsive navigation bar with smooth layout
- Clean home page with name, title, and a profile image
- About section with short biography and goal
- Contact form with required fields (First Name, Email, Message)
- Social media icons (Facebook & Instagram) with hover effect
- Form submission triggers a thank-you alert using JavaScript
- Clear footer with navigation link

## 🎨 Design & Styling
- Follows a modern **light gray and dark gray aesthetic**
- Font families used: `Poppins` for headers and `Roboto` for content
- Section layout, fonts, and color scheme are closely matched to the digital wireframe
- Smooth hover transitions on buttons and icons for a clean, polished feel

## ⚠️ Deviations from Digital Wireframe
- Minor adjustments in color contrast for accessibility and legibility
- Placeholder images and icons used; user can replace them with actual assets
- Layout spacing was slightly optimized for better browser responsiveness
